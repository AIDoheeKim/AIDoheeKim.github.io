    abstract={Time-series forecasting is fundamental in industrial domains like manufacturing and smart factories. As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.},

  abstract={Predictive process monitoring (PPM) faces challenges when process patterns evolve over time, as prediction models experience performance degradation due to concept drift while losing accuracy on previously learned process variants through catastrophic forgetting. This study addresses these challenges in outcome-oriented PPM by integrating continual learning principles with process mining domain knowledge. We propose an adaptive memory mechanism that extracts process structure information through activity relationship analysis, categorizing relationships between activities as "Always Follows," "Sometimes Follows," or "Never Follows." The mechanism computes relation entropy vectors to characterize process patterns and uses cosine similarity between current and historical process patterns to adaptively weight memory buffers during model training. This allows the model to weight historically relevant process knowledge based on pattern similarity. We evaluate the mechanism using stability, plasticity, and trade-off metrics on the Business Process Intelligence Challenge 2015 dataset across multiple temporal splits. Results show that the adaptive memory mechanism achieves stability of 0.87 ± 0.06, plasticity of 0.84 ± 0.11, and trade-off of 0.85 ± 0.08, achieving competitive performance compared to established baseline methods. The mechanism provides explainability through visualizations that demonstrate how the model weights different memory buffers during training. Validation using concept drift detection techniques confirms that the mechanism’s behavior aligns with observable process changes, indicating adaptation to evolving process patterns while reducing catastrophic forgetting.},

  abstract = {Maritime transport handles over 80% of global trade but rising traffic density and congestion have increased collision risk. Traditional assessment methods, including the ship domain and closest point-of-approach approaches, are limited to pairwise interactions and cannot capture regional traffic dynamics. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a regional collision risk assessment framework integrating AIS-derived relative traffic representations, convolutional neural networks, and explainable artificial intelligence. A gradient-weighted class activation mapping framework generated risk influence distribution maps and a centroid radial distribution, while a novel indicator, the risk influence radius (RIR), quantified radial influence patterns. Experiments with 3,660 low-risk and 366 high-risk cases from South Korean coastal waters revealed that the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) network backbone achieved the highest performance, with an average F1-score of 0.9324, outperforming ResNeXt, EfficientNet, ResNet, and MobileNetV3 models. Statistical tests revealed a significant difference in RIR (p < 0.05) between high- and low-risk collision areas at 10 and 20 km, but not at 30 km. These results confirm RIR as an interpretable indicator of collision risk at regional scales, while highlighting its limitations at broader ranges. The framework combines accuracy with interpretability and supports practical applications such as maritime monitoring, route planning, and early warning systems.applications such as maritime monitoring, route planning, and early warning systems.},

  abstract={Anomaly detection in business processes is crucial to prevent erroneous organizational decision-making. Existing anomaly detection methods often assume access to a clean event log without anomalies, a scenario that is impractical in the real world. To solve this problem, MuGAD is proposed, a novel framework that detects anomalies in scenarios where only a limited number of labeled anomalies are available. By converting traces into a newly designed graph structure, the framework captures the control flow, order of events, and attribute information, facilitating the effective use of graph neural networks. Furthermore, MuGAD uses a two-stage training procedure designed to (1) reduce the risks posed by unlabeled traces and (2) enable the detection of anomalous traces and events. Comparative experiments are conducted on five real-life event logs to validate our proposed framework. The experimental results indicate that MuGAD outperforms the existing methods and provides better detection accuracy along with better interpretability in terms of F1-score.},

  abstract={Forecasting the maritime economics index, including container volume and Baltic Panamax Index, is essential for long-term planning and decision-making in the shipping industry. However, studies on container volume prediction are not sufficient, and the bulk freight index has highly fluctuating characteristics, which pose a challenge in long-term prediction. This study proposes a new hybrid framework for the long-term prediction of the maritime economics index. The framework consists of time-series decomposition to break down a time-series into several components (trend, seasonality, and residual), a two-stage attention mechanism that prioritizes important variables to increase long-term prediction accuracy and a long short-term memory network that predicts and combines all components to derive the final predictive outcome. Extensive experiments are conducted using the container volume data, bulk freight index data, and various external variables. The proposed framework achieved a better predictive performance than existing time-series methods, including conventional machine learning and deep learning-based models, in the long-term prediction of container volume and the Baltic Panamax Index. Hence, the proposed method can help in decision-making through accurate long-term predictions of the maritime economics index.},

  abstract={Time-series forecasting (TSF) is a traditional problem in the field of artificial intelligence, and models such as recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, and gate recurrent units have contributed to improving its predictive accuracy. Furthermore, model structures have been proposed to combine time-series decomposition methods such as seasonal-trend decomposition using LOESS. However, this approach is learned in an independent model for each component, and therefore, it cannot learn the relationships between the time-series components. In this study, we propose a new neural architecture called a correlation recurrent unit (CRU) that can perform time-series decomposition within a neural cell and learn correlations (autocorrelation and correlation) between each decomposition component. The proposed neural architecture was evaluated through comparative experiments with previous studies using four univariate and four multivariate time-series datasets. The results showed that long- and short-term predictive performance was improved by more than 10%. The experimental results indicate that the proposed CRU is an excellent method for TSF problems compared to other neural architectures.},

  ranking through two approaches: Feature Importance (FI) derived from the model-specific
  using different prediction models and model-agnostic using iterative experiments. Finally,
  we construct feature subsets based on the sum of these rankings and criteria. Through
  experiments, we validate the robustness and efficiency of our approach. By utilizing this

  abstract={The maritime industry plays a central role in global trade but also contributes significantly to environmental degradation due to high fuel consumption. Accordingly, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has introduced environmental regulations, including the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). Complying with these regulations requires accurate fuel consumption forecasting to support optimal voyage planning. However, ship operation data frequently contain missing and anomalous values due to sensor failures, which reduce the accuracy of forecasts that rely on time-series characteristics. Although previous studies have applied machine learning and time-series models, they often fail to employ temporal dependencies or maintain data continuity. This study proposes a time-series forecasting framework that separates movement and anchorage states and performs imputation using environmental variables and similar trajectory group. The proposed method effectively leverages sensor data, despite frequent missing and anomalous values, and improves forecasting performance. The proposed framework facilitates voyage optimization by enabling accurate speed estimation and ensuring compliance with CII regulations.},

따라서, 본 연구에서는 산업현장에서 적재 계획의 수정이 용이한 화물 적재 방법론을 제시한다. 화물의 특성에 따른 불용 공간과 컨테이너 내부 현황을 고려할 수 있도록 하여 산업 현장의 요구사항을 반영하고, 3차원 공간을 2차원 평면 레이어로 조작하여 적재 계획을 수립하여 시간 복잡도를 줄임으로써 산업현장의 활용성을 높였다. 본 연구에서 제시하는 방법론을 통해 화물 적재 계획 품질의 일관성을 높이고, 적재 계획 수립 자동화에 기여를 할 수 있다.},

  abstract={컨테이너 운임은 대외 수출 비중이 높은 우리나라 산업의 물류비용을 결정하는 중요한 요인 중 하나이며, 산업 및 물가에 직접적인 영향을 미치는 중요한 경제 지표 중 하나이다. COVID-19 발생 이후 강한 충격에 급격히 상승한 운임에 대해 관련 영향 요인을 파악하고, 이를 정확히 예측하는 모델의 필요성이 대두되었다. 본 연구에서는 컨테이너 운임 지수 중 하나인 SCFI에 대한 정확한 예측을 목표로 하는 딥러닝 모델 기반의 프레임워크를 제안하고, 설명할 수 있는 인공지능 방법론 중 하나인 SHAP을 이용하여 사후 분석을 수행하였다. GRU, LSTM, RNN 모형 중 GRU 모형이 가장 좋은 예측 성능을 보였으며, 1주, 4주 예측 시 90%이상의 높은 예측 정확도를 보였으나, 12주 예측 시 80%이상의 예측 정확도를 보였다. 또한 SHAP 분석을 통해 변수 별 중요도를 바탕으로 구성한 변수 조합으로 실험 시 예측 성능이 개선되는 것을 확인하였다. 이를 통해 딥러닝 방법론이 가지고 있던 고질적인 한계점인 설명력 문제를 일부 해소하고, 예측력 개선에서도 활용할 수 있을 것이라 기대된다.},
