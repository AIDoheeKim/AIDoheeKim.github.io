Hello! I am **Dohee Kim**, a professor in the Department of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Convergence Engineering at Changwon National University. Our Data Optimization Lab focuses on data-driven decision-making and optimization methodologies.

My research interests include **Time Series Analysis**, **Optimization**, **machine/deep learning-based modeling**, **data analytics**, and designing algorithms that can be applied to real-world problems (e.g., resource allocation, scheduling, and operations/system optimization). I aim to combine mathematical modeling with data-centric approaches to develop solutions that are both interpretable and practical.

We are currently recruiting motivated students who are interested in working with us.
