Welcome to **DOLab (Data Optimization Lab)**! I am **Dohee Kim**, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence Engineering at Changwon National University.

Our lab focuses on developing **data-driven optimization** methodologies to solve complex real-world problems. Key research areas include:
- Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
- Machine/Deep Learning-based Modeling
- Optimization Algorithms (scheduling, resource allocation, operations management)
- Explainable AI (XAI)

We aim to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications by combining mathematical modeling with data-centric approaches.

**We are actively recruiting motivated students** who share our passion for research. If you are interested in joining DOLab, please reach out via email with your CV and a brief statement of interest.
